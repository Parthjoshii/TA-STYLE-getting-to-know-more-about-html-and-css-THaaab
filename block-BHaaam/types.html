            <p><b>Sweet</b><br>
            Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose, a molecule combining glucose and fructose.<br>
            Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as sucralose are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories.<br>
            Other types of sugar include raw sugar, which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.
            The stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal
            </p>
            <p><b>Sour</b><br>
                Sourness is caused by the taste of acids, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages.<br>
                Sour foods include citrus, specifically lemons, limes, and to a lesser degree oranges.<br>
                Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria.<br>
                Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.
            </p>
            <p><b>Salty</b><br>
                Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium.<br>
                It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant.<br>
                There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, kosher salt, mined salt, and grey salt.<br>
                Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function.<br>
                Salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function.<br>
                Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer.<br>
                Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion.<br>
                Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.
            </p>
            <p><b>Bitter</b><br>
                Bitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste.<br>
                Unsweetened dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.
