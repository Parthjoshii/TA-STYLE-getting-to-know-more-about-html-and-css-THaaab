            <p> Some popular types of ethnic foods include Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, American, Cajun, Thai, African, Indian and Nepalese.<br>
                Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food habits.<br>
                While evolutionarily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are omnivores, religion and social constructs such as morality, activism, or environmentalism will often affect which foods they will consume.<br>
                Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of taste, the perception of flavor from eating and drinking.<br>
                Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.

            <p><b>Italian cuisine (Italian: Cucina italiana)</b> is a Mediterranean cuisine consisting of the ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques developed across the Italian Peninsula since antiquity, and later spread around the world together with waves of Italian diaspora.<br>
               Significant changes occurred with the colonization of the Americas and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, capsicums, maize and sugar beet — the latter introduced in quantity in the 18th century.<br>
               It is one of the best known and most appreciated gastronomies worldwide.
               The Mediterranean diet forms the basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and vegetables.<br>
               Cheese, cold cuts and wine are central to Italian cuisine, and along with pizza and coffee (especially espresso) form part of Italian gastronomic culture.<br>
               Desserts have a long tradition of merging local flavours such as citrus fruits, pistachio and almonds with sweet cheeses like mascarpone and ricotta or exotic tastes as cocoa, vanilla and cinnamon.<br>
               Gelato,tiramisù and cassata are among the most famous examples of Italian desserts, cakes and patisserie.<br>
               Italian cuisine relies heavily on traditional products; the country has a large number of traditional specialities protected under EU law.<br>
               Italy is the world's largest producer of wine, as well as the country with the widest variety of indigenous grapevine varieties in the world.
            </p>
            <p><b>French cuisine (French: Cuisine française)</b> consists of the cooking traditions and practices from France.<br>
                Its cuisine has been influenced throughout the centuries by the many surrounding cultures of Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and Belgium, in addition to its own food traditions on the long western coastlines of the Atlantic, the Channel and inland.<br>
                There are many dishes considered part of French cuisine.<br>
                Some dishes are considered universally accepted as part of the national cuisine, while others fit into a unique regional cuisine.<br>
                There are also breads, charcuterie items as well as desserts that fit.
            </p>
            <p><b>Indian cuisine</b> consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent.<br>
               Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables, and fruits.
               Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion, in particular Hinduism and Islam, cultural choices and traditions.<br>
               Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played a role in introducing certain foods to this country.<br>
               The Columbian discovery of the New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India. A number of these such as potatoes, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts, and guava have become staples in many regions of India.
