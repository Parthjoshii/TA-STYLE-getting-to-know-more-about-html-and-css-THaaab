        <h3>DAY 1</h3>
        <p> Day 1 of the festival started with many artists lined-up for a spectacular performance at different stages across the festival venue<br>
            With the massive mainstage design the fans anf the attendees of the festival were in for a treat.<br>
            Due to the pandemic the festival never took place for 2 years, but now it is back in 2022 with a bang.<br>
            With insane production of the stage with lasers, Pyros & strobes it was surely to light up the sky when darkness fall.<br>
            Day 1 came to an end with a segment they call <b>Spotlight</b>. This year SUB-ZERO PROJECT were the ones closing the day 1 and the spotlight.
