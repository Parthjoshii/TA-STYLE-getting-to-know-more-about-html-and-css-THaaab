            <p><b>Non-vegetarian food (in Indian English sometimes shortened to non-veg food)</b> contains meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, or the flesh of any other animal), and sometimes, eggs.<br>
                When describing people, non-vegetarians eat meat, as opposed to vegetarians.<br>
                The diet, non-vegetarianism is the majority human diet in the world (including India).<br>
                Non-vegetarians are also called omnivores in nutritional science.
            </p>
            <p><b>Vegetarian Diet</b> is based on food that meets vegetarian standards by not including meat and animal tissue products (such as gelatin or animal-derived rennet).<br>
                Lacto-ovo vegetarianism (the most common type of vegetarianism in the Western world) includes eggs and dairy products (such as milk and cheese without rennet).<br>
                Lacto vegetarianism includes dairy products but not eggs, and ovo vegetarianism encompasses eggs but not dairy products.<br>
                The strictest form of vegetarianism is veganism, which excludes all animal products, including dairy, honey, and some refined sugars if filtered and whitened with bone char.<br>
                There are also partial vegetarians, such as pescetarians who eat fish but avoid other types of meat
